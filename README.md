# AWS IAM Privilege Escalation Methods

## 1. Creating a new policy version
### Reference(s)
- https://rhinosecuritylabs.com/aws/aws-privilege-escalation-methods-mitigation/

### Description
An attacker with the `iam:CreatePolicyVersion` permission can create a new version of an IAM policy that they have access to. This allows them to define their own custom permissions. When creating a new policy version, it needs to be set as the default version to take effect, which you would think would require the `iam:SetDefaultPolicyVersion` permission, but when creating a new policy version, it is possible to include a flag (`--set-as-default`) that will automatically create it as the new default version. That flag does not require the `iam:SetDefaultPolicyVersion` permission to use.

### Required Permission(s)
- `iam:CreatePolicyVersion`

### Potential Impact
This privilege escalation method could allow a user to gain full administrator access of the AWS account.

## 2. Setting the default policy version to an existing version
### Reference(s)
- https://rhinosecuritylabs.com/aws/aws-privilege-escalation-methods-mitigation/

### Description
An attacker with the `iam:SetDefaultPolicyVersion` permission may be able to escalate privileges through existing policy versions that are not currently in use. If a policy that they have access to has versions that are not the default, they would be able to change the default version to any other existing version.

### Required Permission(s)
- `iam:SetDefaultPolicyVersion`

### Potential Impact
The potential impact is associated with the level of permissions that the inactive policy version has. This could range from no privilege escalation at all to gaining full administrator access to the AWS account, depending on what the inactive policy versions have access to.

## 3. Creating an EC2 instance with an existing instance profile
### Reference(s)
- https://rhinosecuritylabs.com/aws/aws-privilege-escalation-methods-mitigation/

### Description
An attacker with the `iam:PassRole` and `ec2:RunInstances` permissions can create a new EC2 instance that they will have operating system access to and pass an existing EC2 instance profile/role to it. They can then login to the instance and request the associated AWS keys from the EC2 instance meta data, which gives them access to all the permissions that the associated instance profile/role has.

### Required Permission(s)
- `iam:PassRole`
- `ec2:RunInstances`

### Potential Impact
This attack would give an attacker access to the set of permissions that the instance profile/role has, which again could range from no privilege escalation to full administrator access of the AWS account.

## 4. Creating a new user access key
### Reference(s)
- https://rhinosecuritylabs.com/aws/aws-privilege-escalation-methods-mitigation/

### Description
An attacker with the `iam:CreateAccessKey` permission on other users can create an access key ID and secret access key belonging to another user in the AWS environment, if they don’t already have two sets associated with them (which best practice says they shouldn’t).

### Required Permission(s)
- `iam:CreateAccessKey`

### Potential Impact
This method would give an attacker the same level of permissions as any user they were able to create an access key for, which could range from no privilege escalation to full administrator access to the account.

## 5. Creating a new login profile
### Reference(s)
- https://rhinosecuritylabs.com/aws/aws-privilege-escalation-methods-mitigation/

### Description
An attacker with the `iam:CreateLoginProfile` permission on other users can create a password to use to login to the AWS console on any user that does not already have a login profile setup.

### Required Permission(s)
- `iam:CreateLoginProfile`

### Potential Impact
This method would give an attacker the same level of permissions as any user they were able to create a login profile for, which could range from no privilege escalation to full administrator access to the account.

## 6. Updating an existing login profile
### Reference(s)
- https://rhinosecuritylabs.com/aws/aws-privilege-escalation-methods-mitigation/

### Description
An attacker with the `iam:UpdateLoginProfile` permission on other users can change the password used to login to the AWS console on any user that already has a login profile setup.

### Required Permission(s)
- `iam:UpdateLoginProfile`

### Potential Impact
This method would give an attacker the same level of permissions as any user they were able to update the login profile for, which could range from no privilege escalation to full administrator access to the account.

## 7. Attaching a policy to a user
### Reference(s)
- https://rhinosecuritylabs.com/aws/aws-privilege-escalation-methods-mitigation/

### Description
An attacker with the `iam:AttachUserPolicy` permission can escalate privileges by attaching a policy to a user that they have access to, adding the permissions of that policy to the attacker.

### Required Permission(s)
- `iam:AttachUserPolicy`

### Potential Impact
An attacker would be able to use this method to attach the AdministratorAccess AWS managed policy to a user, giving them full administrator access to the AWS environment.

## 8. Attaching a policy to a group
### Reference(s)
- https://rhinosecuritylabs.com/aws/aws-privilege-escalation-methods-mitigation/

### Description
An attacker with the `iam:AttachGroupPolicy` permission can escalate privileges by attaching a policy to a group that they are a part of, adding the permissions of that policy to the attacker.

### Required Permission(s)

- `sts:AssumeRole`

### Potential Impact
This would give the attacker the privileges that are attached to any role in the account, which could range from no privilege escalation to full administrator access to the account.

## 15. Passing a role to a new Lambda function, then invoking it
### Reference(s)
- https://rhinosecuritylabs.com/aws/aws-privilege-escalation-methods-mitigation/

### Description
A user with the `iam:PassRole`, `lambda:CreateFunction`, and `lambda:InvokeFunction` permissions can escalate privileges by passing an existing IAM role to a new Lambda function that includes code to import the relevant AWS library to their programming language of choice, then using it perform actions of their choice. The code could then be run by invoking the function through the AWS API.

### Required Permission(s)

- `lambda:CreateFunction`
- `lambda:InvokeFunction`

### Potential Impact
This would give a user access to the privileges associated with any Lambda service role that exists in the account, which could range from no privilege escalation to full administrator access to the account.

## 16. Passing a role to a new Lambda function, then invoking it cross-account
### Reference(s)
- None

### Description
A user with the `iam:PassRole`, `lambda:CreateFunction`, and `lambda:AddPermission` permissions can escalate privileges by passing an existing IAM role to a new Lambda function that includes code to import the relevant AWS library to their programming language of choice, then using it perform actions of their choice. The code could then be run by using `lambda:AddPermission` to allow cross-account invocation, then invoking it cross-account with their own attacker account.

### Required Permission(s)
- `iam:PassRole`
- `lambda:CreateFunction`
- `lambda:AddPermission`

### Potential Impact
This would give a user access to the privileges associated with any Lambda service role that exists in the account, which could range from no privilege escalation to full administrator access to the account.

## 17. Passing a role to a new Lambda function, then triggering it with DynamoDB
### Reference(s)
- https://rhinosecuritylabs.com/aws/aws-privilege-escalation-methods-mitigation/

### Description
A user with the `iam:PassRole`, `lambda:CreateFunction`, and `lambda:CreateEventSourceMapping` (and possibly `dynamodb:PutItem` and `dynamodb:CreateTable`) permissions, but without the `lambda:InvokeFunction` permission, can escalate privileges by passing an existing IAM role to a new Lambda function that includes code to import the relevant AWS library to their programming language of choice, then using it perform actions of their choice. They then would need to either create a DynamoDB table or use an existing one, to create an event source mapping for the Lambda function pointing to that DynamoDB table. Then they would need to either put an item into the table or wait for another method to do so that the Lambda function will be invoked.

### Required Permission(s)
- `iam:PassRole`
- `lambda:CreateFunction`
- `lambda:CreateEventSourceMapping`
- `dynamodb:PutItem` (possibly)
- `dynamodb:CreateTable` (possibly)

They would then need to wait for it to be invoked if they were not able to do so directly, but if it already exists, there is likely some way that it will be invoked.

### Required Permission(s)
- `lambda:UpdateFunctionCode`

### Potential Impact
This would give an attacker access to the privileges associated with the Lambda service role that is attached to that function, which could range from no privilege escalation to full administrator access to the account.

## 19. Passing a role to a Glue Development Endpoint
### Reference(s)
- https://rhinosecuritylabs.com/aws/aws-privilege-escalation-methods-mitigation/

### Description
An attacker with the `iam:PassRole` and `glue:CreateDevEndpoint` permissions could create a new AWS Glue development endpoint and pass an existing service role to it. They then could SSH into the instance and use the AWS CLI to have access of the permissions the role has access to.

### Required Permission(s)
- `iam:PassRole`
- `glue:CreateDevEndpoint`

### Potential Impact
This would give an attacker access to the privileges associated with any Glue service role that exists in the account, which could range from no privilege escalation to full administrator access to the account.

## 21. Passing a role to CloudFormation
### Reference(s)
- https://rhinosecuritylabs.com/aws/aws-privilege-escalation-methods-mitigation/

### Description
An attacker with the `iam:PassRole` and `cloudformation:CreateStack` permissions would be able to escalate privileges by creating a CloudFormation template that will perform actions and create resources using the permissions of the role that was passed when creating a CloudFormation stack.

### Required Permission(s)
- `iam:PassRole`
- `cloudformation:CreateStack`

### Potential Impact
This would give an attacker access to the privileges associated with the role that was passed when creating the CloudFormation stack, which could range from no privilege escalation to full administrator access to the account.

## 22. Passing a role to Data Pipeline
### Reference(s)
- https://rhinosecuritylabs.com/aws/aws-privilege-escalation-methods-mitigation/

### Description
An attacker with the `iam:PassRole`, `datapipeline:CreatePipeline`, and `datapipeline:PutPipelineDefinition` permissions would be able to escalate privileges by creating a pipeline and updating it to run an arbitrary AWS CLI command or create other resources, either once or on an interval with the permissions of the role that was passed in.

### Required Permission(s)
- `iam:PassRole`
- `datapipeline:CreatePipeline`
- `datapipeline:PutPipelineDefinition`

## 23. Creating a CodeStar project from a template
### Reference(s)
- https://rhinosecuritylabs.com/aws/escalating-aws-iam-privileges-undocumented-codestar-api/
- https://github.com/RhinoSecurityLabs/Cloud-Security-Research/blob/master/AWS/codestar_createprojectfromtemplate_privesc/CodeStarPrivEsc.py

### Description
An attacker with the `codestar:CreateProjectFromTemplate` permission can leverage an undocumented CodeStar API to escalate privileges by creating a new CodeStar project from a built-in template. This method also allows arbitrary CloudFormation resource creation under a different set of privileges.

### Required Permission(s)
- `codestar:CreateProjectFromTemplate`

### Potential Impact
This would give the attacker access to the privileges associated with the CodeStar project template that was chosen, along with the permissions granted to the CloudFormation role created along with the project. This results in a reasonable amount of privilege escalation, with a chance to full-administrator, depending on other resources/permissions in the environment. More information can be found in the references section.

## 24. Passing a role to a new CodeStar project
### Reference(s)
- https://rhinosecuritylabs.com/aws/escalating-aws-iam-privileges-undocumented-codestar-api/

### Description
An attacker with the `codestar:CreateProject` and `iam:PassRole` permissions can escalate privileges by creating a new CodeStar project and passing a role to it, where the role will then be used to deploy the resources specified in the CodeStar project.

### Required Permission(s)
- `codestar:CreateProject`
- `iam:PassRole`

### Potential Impact
This would give the attacker the ability to escalate to a full administrator, because the default CodeStar service role has permission to escalate privileges to an administrator. If a custom CodeStar service role has been created, the impact of this privilege escalation method may vary.

## 25. Creating a new CodeStar project and associating a team member
### Reference(s)
- https://rhinosecuritylabs.com/aws/escalating-aws-iam-privileges-undocumented-codestar-api/

### Description
An attacker with the `codestar:CreateProject` and `codestar:AssociateTeamMember` permissions can escalate privileges by creating a new CodeStar project, then associating themselves as the Owner of the project, which will attach an IAM policy to them.

### Required Permission(s)
- `codestar:CreateProject`
- `codestar:AssociateTeamMember`

### Potential Impact
This would give the attacker read-only access to multiple different AWS services and full CodeStar access on the project they are now an Owner of.
